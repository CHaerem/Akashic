## Phase 1: Photo Storage & Upload Infrastructure

### Goal

Move photos from git repo to Cloudflare R2 and build upload tooling.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Cloudflare R2 Setup

- [x] Create R2 bucket (`akashic-media`)
- [x] Create authenticated media Worker (`workers/media-proxy/`)
- [x] JWT verification via Supabase JWKS (public key)
- [x] Worker deployed at `akashic-media.chris-haerem.workers.dev`
- [x] Frontend utilities (`src/lib/media.ts`, `src/hooks/useMedia.ts`)

#### 1.2 Photo Upload API

- [x] Add upload endpoint to media Worker (`POST /upload/journeys/{slug}/photos`)
- [x] File validation (type, size limits)
- [x] Extract EXIF metadata (coordinates, date taken) - client-side via `exifr`
- [x] Handle thumbnail generation (client-side resize before upload)

#### 1.3 Database Integration

- [x] Photo CRUD operations in `src/lib/journeys.ts`
- [x] Link photos to journeys
- [x] Link photos to waypoints (via "Assign Photos" button per day)
- [x] Store extracted EXIF data (coordinates, timestamps)

#### 1.4 Photo Display

- [x] PhotosTab component with upload UI
- [x] Photo grid with thumbnails
- [x] Lightbox for full-size viewing
- [x] Photos organized by day in Journey tab (matched by taken_at date)
- [x] Display photos on map at GPS coordinates (markers with click-to-view)

### Photo Data Model (existing in Supabase)

```sql
photos (
  id UUID,
  journey_id UUID,      -- Required: which journey
  waypoint_id UUID,     -- Optional: specific camp/location
  url TEXT,             -- R2 path (e.g., "journeys/kilimanjaro/photos/abc123.jpg")
  thumbnail_url TEXT,   -- R2 path for thumbnail
  caption TEXT,
  coordinates JSONB,    -- [lng, lat] from EXIF or manual
  taken_at TIMESTAMPTZ, -- From EXIF or manual
  sort_order INTEGER
)
```

### R2 Storage Structure

```
akashic-media/
└── journeys/
    └── {journey_uuid}/
        └── photos/
            ├── {photo_id}.jpg
            └── {photo_id}_thumb.jpg
```

**Note**: Photos are served through authenticated Worker, not directly from R2. Paths use journey UUIDs (migrated from slug-based paths).

---

## Phase 2: Journey Management UI

### Goal

Collaborative interface for family members to create and edit journeys together.

### Tasks

- [ ] Create new journey form (name, type, dates, description)
- [x] Edit journey details (name, country, description, dates, stats via modal)
- [ ] Delete journey (with confirmation)
- [x] Journey visibility: private by default, shared with all authenticated family members (MVP model)

#### 2.2 Waypoint Management

- [x] Add waypoints to journey (via RouteEditor - click on route)
- [x] Edit waypoint details (name, day number, elevation, description, highlights)
- [x] Reorder waypoints (via RouteEditor - drag along route, auto-sorts by distance)
- [x] Delete waypoints (via RouteEditor)
- [x] Click-on-map to set coordinates (via RouteEditor)

#### 2.3 Photo Management

- [x] Bulk photo upload with progress (multi-file select, shows upload status)
- [x] Assign photos to waypoints (via modal)
- [x] Set hero images for journey (via PhotoEditModal)
- [x] Add/edit captions (via PhotoEditModal)
- [x] Edit photo location (via PhotoEditModal with map picker)
- [x] Reorder photos (drag-and-drop in edit mode)
- [x] Delete photos

#### 2.4 Route & Camp Position Management

**Phase A: Camp Placement Editor** ✅

- [x] RouteEditor fullscreen component with draggable markers
- [x] Snap camps to route line when dragged
- [x] Click on route to add new camps

**Phase C: Intelligent Route Drawing** ✅

- [x] Draw mode toggle (Edit vs Draw sub-modes)
- [x] Freehand drawing with mouse/touch gestures
- [x] Real-time drawing preview layer
- [x] Mapbox Map Matching API integration (snap to trails)
- [x] Auto-fallback to simplified freehand when no trails nearby
- [x] Visual feedback (snapped vs freehand)
- [x] Mobile touch support (single finger = draw, two fingers = pan)

**Phase D: Route Import** (Future)

- [ ] GPX re-import with merge options

## Phase 2.5: Immersive Exploration

### Goal

Deepen the journey exploration experience by connecting map, photos, elevation, and route into a cohesive, interactive narrative. Keep it calm and simple while making exploration more engaging.

### Priority Order

#### 2.5.1 Interactive Elevation Profile ✅

Transform the static elevation chart into an interactive exploration tool.

- [ ] Show "Day X - between Camp A and Camp B"
- [ ] Display distance walked, elevation change for segment
- [ ] Jump to that day's photos from route click

#### 2.5.6 Journey Playback Mode

Meditative "walk through" experience.

**Status**: Implementation stashed (`git stash list` to see). Revisit when more photos are added to journeys.

- [ ] Play button starts automatic camp-to-camp progression
- [ ] Camera moves smoothly between waypoints
- [ ] Day/night cycle simulation (dawn → midday → sunset per day segment)
- [ ] Photos fade in as you "arrive" at each day (5 second pause with gallery)
- [ ] Pause/resume, manual control with arrow keys
- [ ] Optional ambient mode (minimal UI)

- [x] Poster frame from generated thumbnail
- [x] Native browser controls (play/pause, volume, fullscreen)
- [x] Warning banner for incompatible video formats (.mov)

### Video Upload Workflow

**Browser Upload**: Currently images only. Videos require format conversion that would add significant client-side weight (ffmpeg.wasm ~25MB).

**Bulk Upload Script** (recommended for videos):
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="..." npx tsx scripts/bulkUploadR2.ts <folder> <journey-slug>
```
- Auto-converts `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.webm` to `.mp4` (H.264)
- Generates thumbnails from video frames
- Extracts EXIF metadata (GPS, dates)

**Migration Script** (for existing .mov files):
```bash
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="..." npx tsx scripts/migrateMovToMp4.ts [--dry-run]
```

### Browser Compatibility

| Format | Safari | Chrome | Firefox | Edge |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|------|
| .mp4 (H.264) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| .mov (QuickTime) | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| .webm | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

**Note**: All videos should be .mp4 for universal support. The app shows a warning banner when viewing .mov files in non-Safari browsers.

### Video Inventory (migrated to .mp4)

- Inca Trail: 7 videos
- Kilimanjaro: 84 videos
- Mount Kenya: 5 videos

## Future: Extended Multi-User Platform

### Vision

A platform where anyone can create and share their travel journeys.

### Features Required

#### User Management

- [ ] Self-service registration (currently disabled)
- [ ] User dashboard (my journeys)
- [ ] User profile editing

#### Extended Sharing

- [ ] Share journey with specific users (email invite)
- [ ] Public journey links (opt-in per journey)
- [ ] Embed widget for blogs
- [ ] Social sharing

#### Collaboration

- [ ] Comments on journeys

## Questions to Resolve

1. ~~**Photo display**: Map markers? Lightbox? Timeline?~~ → **Resolved**: Lightbox done, map markers deferred to Phase 3
2. ~~**EXIF extraction**: Client-side (before upload) or server-side (after upload)?~~ → **Resolved**: Client-side using `exifr` library
3. ~~**Thumbnail generation**: On-demand vs at upload time?~~ → **Resolved**: Client-side at upload time (400px max, JPEG 80%)
